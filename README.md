# Custom Search Engine with Hybrid Relevance Model

## Project Status: Work in Progress

This project is currently under active development. While core search functionality is available, the machine learning model for improved relevance ranking is still being developed and trained.

## Overview

This custom search engine uses a Hybrid Relevance Model to provide more accurate and personalized search results. It combines traditional search techniques with machine learning to improve result rankings based on user feedback.

## Features

- Basic search functionality
- Logging of search queries and results
- User feedback collection for search result relevance
- (In Progress) Machine learning model for improved result ranking

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Flask application: `python app.py`
4. Access the search engine through your web browser at `http://localhost:5000`

## Current Limitations

- The machine learning model is not yet fully implemented
- Relevance rankings are currently based on basic algorithms
- Full personalization features are still in development

## Contributing

This project is personal and not open for contributions at this time. However, feel free to fork the repository and experiment with your own improvements!
